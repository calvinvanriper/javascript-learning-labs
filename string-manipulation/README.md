# Mask Email Function

## 📝 Description

This exercise practices JavaScript string manipulation. The function takes an email address and returns a masked version where only the first and last character of the username are visible — the rest are replaced with `*`. The domain remains unchanged.

### Example

    "jsmith@example.com" → "j****h@example.com"

## 🎯 Concepts Practiced

- Locating characters using `indexOf()`
- Extracting text using `slice()`
- Rebuilding strings with template literals
- Thinking about privacy & secure data display
- Handling edge-case input safely

## 💡 Reflection

This lab helped me practice:

- Breaking a problem into smaller steps  
- Working with string indexes  
- Re-constructing values from multiple parts  

It also made me more aware of real-world privacy considerations, such as masking account details before displaying them to users. I’m also starting to think more about edge-cases, like very short usernames or missing `@` symbols.

More string manipulation labs will be added here as I continue learning 🙂

# Mask Email Function

## 📝 Description

This exercise practices JavaScript string manipulation. The function takes an email address and returns a masked version where only the first and last character of the username are visible — the rest are replaced with `*`. The domain remains unchanged.

Example:

```text
"jsmith@example.com" → "j****h@example.com"

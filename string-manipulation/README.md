# String Manipulation Labs

## 📝 Description

This folder contains JavaScript exercises focused on working with strings — including slicing, masking, formatting, and rebuilding text. Each lab practices real-world concepts such as input handling, UI-friendly formatting, and safe data display.

More string focused labs will be added here as I continue learning.

## 📧 Mask Email Function

This exercise practices JavaScript string manipulation by hiding part of an email address for privacy. The function returns a masked version where only the first and last character of the username are visible — the rest are replaced with `*`. The domain remains unchanged.

### Example

```
jsmith@example.com → j****h@example.com
```

### Concepts Practiced

- Locating characters using `indexOf()`
- Extracting text using `slice()`
- Rebuilding strings with template literals
- Thinking about privacy-aware UI design
- Handling edge-case input safely

### Reflection

This lab helped me practice breaking a problem into smaller steps, working with string indexes, and reconstructing text from multiple parts. It also introduced real-world privacy considerations — such as masking account details before displaying them to users.

## ✂️ Truncate String Function

This exercise truncates text when it exceeds a specified length and appends an ellipsis (`...`). If the string is already short enough, it returns the original value unchanged.

### Example

```
truncateString("Hello World",5) → "Hello..."
```

### Concepts Practiced

- Measuring string length with `.length`
- Extracting substrings with `.slice()`
- Conditional logic to handle multiple outcomes
- Writing small reusable utility functions

### Reflection

This lab helped reinforce how conditional logic and string length checks work together. It also connects directly to real UI patterns — like shortening long titles or preview text without altering the underlying data.

## ✅ Confirm String Ending

This exercise checks whether a given string ends with a specified target string. The solution was implemented without using `.endsWith()`, relying instead on string slicing and length comparison.

### Example

```
confirmEnding("Bastian","n") → true
confirmEnding("Open Sesame", "sage") → false
```

### Concepts Practiced

- Extracting substrings using negative indexes
- Comparing string segments for equality
- Re-creating built-in behavior using core methods
- Writing clear boolean-returning functions

### Reflection

This lab helped solidify my understanding of how string indexing works and how built-in methods can be recreated using fundamental operations. It also reinforced the importance of reading problem constraints carefully and choosing simple, direct solutions.

## 💡 Reflection

These labs focused on practical string manipulation patterns commonly used in real-world applications. Each exercise reinforced how small, focused string operations can be combined with conditional logic to safely format, validate, and display text.

Together, these labs helped build confidence working with user-facing data while maintaining clarity, readability, and intent in string-based logic.

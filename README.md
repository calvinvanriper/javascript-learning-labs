## 🌐 Live Demo

Many DOM and mini-project labs are deployed and available for interactive use:

➡️ https://calvinvanriper.dev/javascript-learning-labs/

This demonstrates real-world deployment practices and allows projects to be evaluated independently of the repository.

---

## 📝 Overview

This repository is a structured collection of JavaScript labs completed during formal programming study and independent practice.

Each lab focuses on a specific language concept or programming pattern, progressing from foundational syntax to interactive, event-driven applications.

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Reinforce core JavaScript concepts through hands-on implementation
- Document learning progression and problem-solving development
- Establish consistent engineering standards across all exercises
- Serve as a long-term reference and professional portfolio artifact

This repository prioritizes clarity, consistency, and maintainability over optimization or abstraction.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topic area:

```
/topic-folder/ → Concept-focused labs
/mini-projects/ → Multi-concept applications
```

Each topic folder contains focused exercises designed to isolate and reinforce specific programming patterns.

---

## 📏 Repository Standards

This repository follows strict consistency, formatting, and documentation standards to ensure maintainability and long-term clarity.

See: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

These standards define file structure, documentation requirements, formatting rules, and interaction patterns used across all labs.

---

## 🗂 Current Topics

These labs document progressive skill development through structured practical exercises.

### 🧠 Algorithms

Problem-solving exercises focused on transforming input into output through structured logic and computational thinking.  
➡️ [`Open folder`](./algorithms)

### 🔀 Logic & Control Flow

Decision-making, conditional branching, and state-driven program behavior.  
➡️ [`Open folder`](./logic-and-control-flow)

### 🔁 Loops

Iteration patterns for processing data and building results incrementally.  
➡️ [`Open folder`](./loops)

### ➗ Math Basics

Arithmetic operations, formulas, and logic-based calculations.  
➡️ [`Open folder`](./math-basics)

### 🧵 String Manipulation

Text parsing, formatting, reconstruction, and transformation techniques.  
➡️ [`Open folder`](./string-manipulation)

### 📚 Arrays

Working with ordered data collections, including selection, mutation, and safe state management.  
➡️ [`Open folder`](./arrays)

### 🧱 Objects

Structured data modeling using properties, access patterns, and object-based organization.  
➡️ [`Open folder`](./objects)

### 🖱️ DOM Manipulation & Events

Interactive front-end applications connecting user input to dynamic interface behavior.  
➡️ [`Open folder`](./dom-and-events)

### 🧩 Mini Projects

Integrated applications combining multiple concepts into complete working programs.  
➡️ [`Open folder`](./mini-projects)

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as a documented progression from foundational JavaScript syntax to structured application development.

It reflects deliberate practice, structured learning, and increasing engineering discipline over time.

The repository is intentionally maintained as a stable record of technical growth rather than an experimental sandbox.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Browser runtime (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- Node.js (standalone script execution)
- Visual Studio Code development environment
- ESLint for code quality enforcement
- Prettier for formatting consistency

No frameworks or build systems are required.

---

## 📚 Background

Exercises and project structures are inspired by formal coursework and structured learning platforms, including:

- FreeCodeCamp
- LinkedIn Learning
- Coursera
- Independent structured practice and exploration

All implementations are written and maintained independently.

---

## ▶️ Running the Labs

These labs use plain JavaScript and can be executed in either a browser or Node.js environment.

### Browser Console

1. Open any webpage
2. Open Developer Tools → Console
3. Paste and execute code from a lab file

### Node.js

```bash
node path/to/file.js
```

---

## 🧭 Lifecycle Status

This repository is actively maintained during the JavaScript certification phase.

Upon completion of the core certification track, the repository will transition to maintenance mode and remain as a permanent reference and portfolio artifact documenting foundational JavaScript competency.

Future application development will occur in separate, dedicated repositories.

This repository is a collection of small JavaScript labs that I’ve completed while studying programming. Each lab focuses on a specific JavaScript concept such as strings, arrays, objects, functions, and control flow.

The goal of this repo is not just to store code, but to document my learning process and growth as a developer. Wherever possible, I include explanations of what the exercise is doing and what I learned from it.

## 📂 Repo Structure

The repository is organized by topic area:

```
/topic-folder/ → Concept-focused labs
/mini-projects/ → Multi-concept programs
```

---

## 🗂 Current Topics

These labs document my JavaScript learning journey through small, focused practical exercises.

### 🔁 Logic & Control Flow

Focused exercises on decision-making, branching, and tracking state across multiple function calls.
➡️ [`Open folder`](./logic-and-control-flow/)

### 🔁 Loops

Iteration, tracking values, and building results step-by-step  
➡️ [`Open folder`](./loops)

### ➗ Math Basics

Practical exercises using arithmetic, formulas, and logical rules.  
➡️ [`Open folder`](./math-basics)

### 🧵 String Manipulation

Focused exercises in slicing, formatting, and rebuilding text.  
➡️ [`Open folder`](./string-manipulation)

### 📚 Arrays

Working with collections of data, including adding, removing, selecting, and displaying items while managing shared state safely.  
➡️ [`Open folder`](./arrays)

### 🧩 Mini Projects

Small, self-contained programs that combine multiple concepts into a single working solution. These projects are designed to bridge the gap between individual concept labs and more complete, real-world program logic.  
➡️ [`Open folder`](./mini-projects)

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository documents hands-on JavaScript practice through small, focused labs and mini-projects. It serves as a record of skill development, problem-solving growth, and progressive mastery of core language concepts.

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Runs in browser console or Node.js

## 📚 Background

Many of these exercises are inspired by:

- FreeCodeCamp
- LinkedIn Learning
- Coursera
- Personal exploration and practice challenges

---

## 🧭 Ongoing Learning

This repository continues to grow as new JavaScript topics are studied and practiced. New labs and mini-projects are added over time to reflect increasing depth and complexity.

## ▶️ Running the Labs

These labs use plain JavaScript and can be run easily:

### Browser Console

1. Open any webpage
2. Open DevTools → Console
3. Paste code from a lab file and run

### Node.js

```bash
node path/to/file.js
```

No frameworks or build tools are required.

## ✅ Status

This repo will continue to grow as I learn more — stay tuned 🙂

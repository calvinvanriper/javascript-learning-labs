# Mini Projects

## 📝 Description

This folder contains small, self-contained JavaScript projects that combine multiple concepts into a single working program. These projects go beyond individual drills and focus on applying logic, data structures, and functions together to solve a problem.

Each mini project is designed to reinforce foundational JavaScript skills while gradually moving toward more realistic program behavior.

## 🧩 Current Mini Projects

### 🎯 Trivia — Random Computer Answer

**Folder:** [`trivia-random-answer`](./trivia-random-answer/)

This mini project simulates a simple trivia round by selecting a random question and a random answer choice (representing a computer’s guess). The program then evaluates whether the computer’s choice matches the correct answer.

**Concepts practiced:**

- Arrays of objects
- Random selection using `Math.random()`
- Function composition
- Conditional logic and control flow

### 💿 Record Collection Update

**Folder:** [`record-collection`](./record-collection/)

This mini project updates a nested record collection object based on a defined set of rules. It demonstrates how to modify object properties, manage arrays within objects, and apply conditional logic to handle multiple edge cases.

**Concepts practiced:**

- Working with nested objects and arrays
- Conditional logic with multiple branches
- Updating and deleting object properties
- Reasoning about state changes step-by-step

## 💡 Reflection

These mini projects help bridge the gap between individual concept labs and more complete programs. Rather than focusing on one idea in isolation, each project requires combining multiple concepts to produce meaningful output.

As additional mini projects are added, this folder will continue to grow to reflect increasing complexity and confidence in JavaScript fundamentals.

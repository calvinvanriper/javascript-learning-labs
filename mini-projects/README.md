# Mini Projects

## 📝 Description

This folder contains small, self-contained JavaScript projects that combine multiple concepts into a single working program. These projects go beyond individual drills and focus on applying logic, data structures, and functions together to solve a problem.

Each mini project is designed to reinforce foundational JavaScript skills while moving toward real-world program behavior.

## 🎯 Trivia — Random Computer Answer

**File:** `trivia-random-answer.js`

A simple trivia simulation that randomly selects a question and an answer choice, then evaluates whether the computer's selection is correct.

### Concepts Practiced

- Arrays of objects
- Random selection using `Math.random()`
- Function composition
- Conditional logic and control flow

## 📊 Gradebook App

**File:** `gradebook-app/gradebook.js`

A small gradebook system that calculates a class average, converts numeric scores into letter grades, determines pass/fail status, and generates a student-facing summary message.

### Concepts Practiced

- Function composition and reuse
- Iterating over arrays to compute aggregates
- Conditional logic and grading rules
- Boolean logic for pass/fail evaluation
- Producing formatted, user-readable output

---

## 💿 Record Collection Update

**File:** `record-collection.js`

A rule-driven record collection update system that modifies nested object properties and arrays based on specific conditions.

### Concepts Practiced

- Working with nested objects and arrays
- Conditional logic with multiple branches
- Updating and deleting object properties
- Reasoning about state changes step-by-step

## 💡 Reflection

These mini projects help bridge the gap between individual concept labs and more complete programs. Rather than focusing on one idea in isolation, each project requires combining multiple concepts to produce meaningful output.

As additional mini projects are added, this folder will continue to grow to reflect increasing complexity and confidence in JavaScript fundamentals.

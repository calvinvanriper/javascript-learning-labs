# Gradebook App

## 📝 Description

This mini project builds a small gradebook system that evaluates student performance based on numeric test scores. Multiple helper functions work together to calculate a class average, assign letter grades, determine pass/fail status, and generate a student-facing summary message.

The goal of this project is to practice composing small, single-purpose functions into a cohesive program.

## 🧠 What This Project Does

- Accepts an array of numeric test scores representing a class
- Calculates the class average score
- Converts numeric scores into letter grades based on defined grading rules
- Determines whether a student has passed the course
- Produces a formatted message summarizing the student’s performance

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Practiced

- Function composition and reuse
- Iterating over arrays to compute aggregate values
- Conditional logic and grading rules
- Boolean logic for pass/fail evaluation
- Producing formatted, user-readable output

---

## 📌 Example Behavior

When the program runs, it can generate a summary message like:

```
Class average: 78.8. Your grade: B. You passed the course.
```

This output demonstrates how multiple functions work together to evaluate and report student performance.

## 💡 Reflection

This project reinforced the importance of writing small, focused functions that each handle a single responsibility. It also highlighted how clearly defined function contracts make it easier to compose logic without introducing errors.

Working through the requirements emphasized careful reading, consistency between functions, and validating assumptions through testing.

## 🍽️ Lunch Menu Manager

This exercise simulates managing a lunch menu using an array. The program allows items to be added or removed from both the beginning and end of the menu, randomly selects an item, and displays the current menu contents.

### 📌 Example Behavior (Lunch Menu Manager)

```text
"Tacos" added to the end of the lunch menu.
"Sushi" added to the start of the lunch menu.
"Burger" removed from the end of the lunch menu.
Randomly selected lunch: Pizza
Menu items: Soup, Tacos, Pizza
```

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced (Lunch Menu Manager)

- Adding items with `push()` and `unshift()`
- Removing items with `pop()` and `shift()`
- Accessing array length for safety checks
- Selecting random elements using `Math.random()`
- Displaying array contents with `join()`
- Mutating shared state intentionally and safely

### 💡 Reflection (Lunch Menu Manager)

## 🧹 Falsy Remover (Bouncer)

This exercise filters an input array and returns a new array containing only **truthy** values. Any values that evaluate to `false` in a Boolean context are removed.

The solution manually iterates through the array, checks each value's truthiness, and builds a new array with only valid entries.

### 📌 Example Behavior (Falsy Remover)

```javascript
bouncer([7, 'ate', '', false, 9]) → [7, 'ate', 9]
bouncer([false, null, 0, NaN, undefined, '']) → []
bouncer([null, NaN, 1, 2, undefined]) → [1, 2]
```

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced (Falsy Remover)

- Iterating over arrays with loops
- Understanding **truthy vs falsy** values in JavaScript
- Using conditional logic to filter data
- Constructing new arrays without mutating the original

## 🔗 Unite Unique Arrays

This exercise merges multiple arrays into a single array that contains only unique values, while preserving the order in which values first appear.

The solution manually iterates through each input array and builds a new array by adding values only if they have not already been included.

### 📌 Example Behavior (Unite Unique)

```javascript
uniteUnique([1, 3, 2], [5, 2, 1, 4], [2, 1]) → [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]
uniteUnique([1, 2, 3], [5, 2, 1]) → [1, 2, 3, 5]
uniteUnique(['a', 1, true], [1, 'a', false]) → ['a', 1, true, false]
```

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced (Unite Unique)

- Working with multiple arrays using rest parameters
- Iterating through nested arrays
- Checking for uniqueness with `.includes()`
- Preserving insertion order while filtering duplicates

- Iterating through strings character-by-character
- Building nested arrays (arrays within arrays)
- Applying rule-based conditional logic
- Normalizing input for consistent comparison
- Mapping single values to structured data

### 💡 Reflection (DNA Pair Generator)

This lab introduces structured data construction by transforming a simple string into a two-dimensional array. It reinforces how rule-based logic can be used to map individual values into related pairs, and demonstrates how nested data structures are created programmatically. The exercise also highlights the importance of normalizing input before processing.

## ⏭️ Drop Elements Until Condition Met

This exercise removes elements from the beginning of an array until a specified condition is satisfied. The function uses a callback to test each element and returns the remaining portion of the array starting from the first element that passes the test.

### 📌 Example Behavior (Drop Elements)

```javascript
dropElements([1, 2, 3, 4], n => n >= 3) → [3, 4]
dropElements([0, 1, 0, 1], n => n === 1) → [1, 0, 1]
dropElements([1, 2, 3, 4], n => n > 5) → []
```

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced (Drop Elements)

- Iterating through arrays with loop control
- Using callback functions as parameters
- Conditional logic to determine stopping points

## 📚 Library Manager

This lab works with an array of book objects to extract, filter, and aggregate information about a small library catalog. The functions transform structured data into readable lists, targeted results, and summary statistics.

### 📌 Example Behavior (Library Manager)

```javascript
getBookInformation(library) → "Atomic Habits by James Clear\n..."
getBooksByAuthor(library, "Arvid Kahl")
   → [{ title: "The Embedded Entrepreneur", ... }, { title: "Zero to Sold", ... }]
getTotalPages(library) → 2512
```

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced (Library Manager)

- Transforming arrays of objects using `.map()`
- Filtering structured data with `.filter()`
- Aggregating numeric values using `.reduce()`
- Working with object properties inside array operations
- Converting structured data into formatted output

### 💡 Reflection (Library Manager)

This lab reinforces how arrays of objects are manipulated in real-world JavaScript. Instead of working with simple numbers or strings, the data now contains multiple properties per item, requiring precise selection and transformation. The exercise demonstrates how array methods can be combined to extract meaningful insights (lists, subsets, totals) from structured datasets, mirroring common data-processing tasks in applications.

## 📖 Book Organizer

This lab filters and sorts an array of book objects based on release year. It demonstrates how multiple array methods can be combined to extract a meaningful subset of data and then order it deterministically.

### 📌 Example Behavior (Book Organizer)

```javascript
filteredBooks.length → 10
filteredBooks[0].title → "The Wizard's First Rule"
filteredBooks[filteredBooks.length - 1].title → "Naked Empire"
```

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced (Boor Organizer)

- Filtering arrays of objects using `.filter()`
- Sorting objects with a custom comparator function
- Comparing numeric object properties
- Using callback functions with array methods
- Working with real-world structured datasets

### 💡 Reflection (Book Organizer)

This lab reinforces how array methods can be chained together to transform structured data into a curated result set. Instead of manipulating individual values, the logic operates on objects with multiple properties, requiring deliberate comparison rules. The exercise highlights how filtering reduces a dataset to relevant entries, while sorting imposes predictable order—both common operations in real-world applications.

## 📍 Sorted Index Finder

This lab determines the correct index where a number should be inserted into an array after the array is sorted numerically. The function ensures the insertion point preserves ascending order.

### 📌 Example Behavior (Sorted Index Finder)

```javascript
getIndexToIns([10, 20, 30, 40, 50], 35) → 3
getIndexToIns([3, 10, 5], 11) → 3
getIndexToIns([], 5) → 0
```

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced (Sorted Index Finder)

- Sorting arrays numerically using a comparator function
- Using `.findIndex()` to locate insertion points
- Comparing numeric values within arrays
- Understanding in-place array mutation with `.sort()`
- Determining positional logic based on ordering rules

Rather than transforming individual elements, the function evaluates relationships between two datasets to determine which values are exclusive to each. This mirrors real-world tasks like data reconciliation, change detection, and difference analysis.

---

## 🗑️ Array Destroyer

This lab removes specific values from an array using additional arguments supplied to the function. It demonstrates how rest parameters and filtering logic work together to eliminate unwanted elements.

### 📌 Example Behavior (Array Destroyer)

```javascript
destroyer([1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 2, 3], 2, 3) → [1, 5, 1]
destroyer(['tree', 'hamburger', 53], 'tree', 53) → ["hamburger"]
destroyer([2, 3, 2, 3], 2, 3) → []
```

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced (Array Destroyer)

- Using rest parameters to collect variable inputs
- Filtering arrays based on exclusion rules
- Comparing values across arrays with `.includes()`
- Returning new arrays without mutating the original
- Applying flexible argument handling in functions

### 💡 Reflection (Array Destroyer)

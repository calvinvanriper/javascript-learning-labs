# 📚 Array Manipulation Labs

This folder contains JavaScript exercises focused on working with arrays — including adding, removing, selecting, and displaying items. These labs practice real-world array operations, state management, and defensive programming techniques.

More array-based labs will be added here as I continue learning 🙂

## 📌 Current Labs

### 1️⃣ Lunch Menu Manager

This exercise simulates managing a lunch menu using an array. The program allows items to be added or removed from both the beginning and end of the menu, randomly selects an item, and displays the current menu contents.

#### Example Actions

```
"Tacos" added to the end of the lunch menu.
"Sushi" added to the start of the lunch menu.
"Burger" removed from the end of the lunch menu.
Randomly selected lunch: Pizza
Menu items: Soup, Tacos, Pizza
```


#### Concepts Practiced

- Adding items with `push()` and `unshift()`
- Removing items with `pop()` and `shift()`
- Accessing array length for safety checks
- Selecting random elements using `Math.random()`
- Displaying array contents with `join()`
- Mutating shared state intentionally and safely

#### Reflection

This lab helped reinforce how arrays can be used to manage changing collections of data. It also emphasized the importance of handling empty arrays safely and writing clear, readable functions that modify shared state in predictable ways.

# 📚 Array Manipulation Labs

## 📝 Description

This folder contains JavaScript exercises focused on working with arrays — including adding, removing, selecting, and displaying items. These labs practice real-world array operations, state management, and basic safety checks.

More array-focused practice labs will be added here as I continue learning.

## 🍽️ Lunch Menu Manager

This exercise simulates managing a lunch menu using an array. The program allows items to be added or removed from both the beginning and end of the menu, randomly selects an item, and displays the current menu contents.

### 📌 Example Behavior

```
"Tacos" added to the end of the lunch menu.
"Sushi" added to the start of the lunch menu.
"Burger" removed from the end of the lunch menu.
Randomly selected lunch: Pizza
Menu items: Soup, Tacos, Pizza
```

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced

- Adding items with `push()` and `unshift()`
- Removing items with `pop()` and `shift()`
- Accessing array length for safety checks
- Selecting random elements using `Math.random()`
- Displaying array contents with `join()`
- Mutating shared state intentionally and safely

### 💡 Reflection

This lab reinforced how arrays can be used to manage collections of data that change over time. It also emphasized the importance of handling empty arrays safely and writing clear, readable functions that modify shared state in predictable ways.

## 🔢 Largest Number Finder

This exercise builds a function that accepts an array of arrays and returns a new array containing the largest number from each sub-array.

### 📌 Example Behavior

```
largestOfAll([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [9, 0]]) → [3, 5, 9]
```

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced

- Iterating over nested arrays
- Working with multidimensional data structures
- Using the spread operator with `Math.max()`
- Aggregating results into a new array
- Keeping functions pure and predictable

### 💡 Reflection

This lab reinforced how to work with nested arrays and extract meaningful values from each sub-collection. It highlighted how built-in utilities like `Math.max()` can simplify logic when combined with array traversal, while still keeping the core problem focused on data structure manipulation.

## 🧬 Slice and Splice Algorithm

This exercise builds a function that inserts the elements of one array into another array at a specified index, returning a new array without modifying either source array.

### 📌 Example Behavior

```
frankenSplice([1, 2], ["a", "b"], 1) → ["a", 1, 2, "b"]
```

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced

- Working with array copies to preserve immutability
- Using `splice()` for controlled insertion
- Managing insertion indexes during iteration
- Combining arrays without mutating source data
- Understanding how array methods affect structure

### 💡 Reflection

This lab reinforced the importance of preserving original data when combining arrays. It highlighted how array methods like `splice()` can be safely used when operating on copies, and how careful index management ensures elements are inserted in the correct order.

## 🧹 Falsy Remover (Bouncer)

This exercise filters an input array and returns a new array containing only **truthy** values. Any values that evaluate to `false` in a Boolean context are removed.

The solution manually iterates through the array, checks each value's truthiness, and builds a new array with only valid entries.

### 📌 Example Behavior

```
bouncer([7, 'ate', '', false, 9]) → [7, 'ate', 9]
bouncer([false, null, 0, NaN, undefined, '']) → []
bouncer([null, NaN, 1, 2, undefined]) → [1, 2]
```

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced

- Iterating over arrays with loops
- Understanding **truthy vs falsy** values in JavaScript
- Using conditional logic to filter data
- Constructing new arrays without mutating the original
- Boolean evaluation in control flow

### 💡 Reflection

This lab introduced a core data-processing pattern: **scan, test, and keep/discard**. It reinforced how JavaScript evaluates values in Boolean contexts and how arrays can be filtered using conditional logic. This exercise serves as a foundational step toward more advanced array methods like `.filter()`, which automate this pattern in modern JavaScript.

## 💡 Topic Reflection

These labs focused on core array operations used in real applications — managing changing collections, extracting values from nested data, and combining arrays safely. Together, they reinforced the difference between mutating and non-mutating approaches and built confidence working with arrays as a primary data structure.

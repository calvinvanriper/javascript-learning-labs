# Math Basics Labs

## 📝 Description

This folder contains JavaScript exercises that focus on math fundamentals and numeric operations. Each lab is built as a small, reusable function that performs a real-world style calculations. These exercises reinforce function structure, return values, and working with mathematical expressions in JavaScript.

More math-focused practice labs will be added here as I continue learning 🙂

## 🌡 Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

This lab builds a function that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the standard conversion formula. It reinforces how mathematical expressions can be translated directly into program logic.

### 📌 Example Behavior

```
convertCtoF(0) → 32
convertCtoF(-30) → -22
convertCtoF(30) → 86
```

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced

- Writing reusable functions
- Returning values
- Using math operations in JavaScript
- Testing with multiple inputs

### 💡 Reflection

This lab reinforced how mathematical formulas can be expressed directly in code. It emphasized the importance of correct operator order and returning values so functions remain reusable rather than tied to console output.

## ❄️ Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius

This lab performs the inverse temperature conversion, turning Fahrenheit values into Celsius. It demonstrates how reversing a formula still follows the same principles of function design and mathematical accuracy.

### 📌 Example Behavior

```
convertFtoC(32) → 0
convertFtoC(14) → -10
convertFtoC(86) → 30
```

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced

- Mathematical order of operations
- Variable naming clarity
- Consistent function design
- Manual output validation

### 💡 Reflection

This lab emphasized the need to carefully apply arithmetic order of operations. It reinforced how small mistakes in math logic can lead to incorrect results, highlighting the value of validating outputs with multiple test cases.

## 📅 Leap Year Checker

Determines whether a given year is a leap year based on the Gregorian calendar rule. This lab practices nested conditional logic along with mathematical operators such as modulo `%`.

### 📌 Example Behavior

```
isLeapYear(1920) → 1920 is a leap year.
isLeapYear(1900) → 1900 is not a leap year.
isLeapYear(1600) → 1600 is a leap year.
```

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced

- Nested conditional logic
- Applying rule precedence in decision-making
- Using modulo (`%`) for divisibility checks
- Translating real-world rules into program logic

### 💡 Reflection

This lab reinforced how multiple conditions can interact to produce a final outcome. It highlighted the importance of rule ordering and how real-world logic often requires layered decision-making rather than a single check.

## 💡 Topic Reflection

These labs strengthened the connection between mathematical reasoning and program logic. Each exercise demonstrated how formulas and numeric rules can be implemented in code through clear function design and structured decision-making.

Together, they reinforced several foundational skills:

- translating math formulas into program instructions
- returning values rather than relying on console output
- validating results with varied test cases
- structuring logic so functions remain reusable

Although simple in scope, these labs build the precision and discipline needed before tackling more complex algorithmic problems.

# Math Basics Labs

## 📝 Description

This folder contains JavaScript exercises that focus on math fundamentals and numeric operations. Each lab is built as a small, reusable function that performs a real-world style calculation. These exercises reinforce function structure, return values, and working with mathematical expressions in JavaScript.

More math-focused practice labs will be added here as I continue learning 🙂

## 🌡 Temperature Conversion Labs

### 1️⃣ Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

**File:** `convert-c-to-f.js`

**Formula**

    F = C × (9/5) + 32

**Example Inputs & Outputs**

    0°C    → 32°F
    -30°C  → -22°F
    -10°C  → 14°F
    20°C   → 68°F
    30°C   → 86°F

**Concepts Practiced**

- Writing reusable functions  
- Returning values  
- Using math operations in JavaScript  
- Testing with multiple inputs

### 2️⃣ Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius

**File:** `convert-f-to-c.js`

**Formula**

    C = (F − 32) × 5/9

**Example Inputs & Outputs**

    32°F  → 0°C
    -22°F → -30°C
    14°F  → -10°C
    68°F  → 20°C
    86°F  → 30°C

**Concepts Practiced**

- Mathematical order of operations  
- Variable naming clarity  
- Consistent function design  
- Manual output validation

## 💡 Reflection

Even though these are simple calculations, they helped reinforce:

- Writing clear, single-purpose functions  
- Returning values rather than printing inside the function  
- Structuring code so it can be reused  
- Validating outputs with test calls  

These exercises are an important step in building confidence with JavaScript fundamentals before moving on to more complex projects.

# Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter

## 📝 Description

This exercise practices writing small reusable JavaScript functions. The goal is to convert a temperature value from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the standard conversion formula:

    Fahrenheit = Celsius × (9/5) + 32

The function accepts a Celsius value as input and returns the converted Fahrenheit value.

## 🧪 Example Inputs & Outputs

    0°C    → 32°F
    -30°C  → -22°F
    -10°C  → 14°F
    20°C   → 68°F
    30°C   → 86°F

## 🎯 Concepts Practiced

- Writing and calling functions
- Using mathematical expressions in JavaScript
- Returning values instead of logging them directly
- Testing functions with multiple inputs

## 💡 Reflection

Even though this is a simple exercise, it helped reinforce the value of small, single-purpose functions. Converting temperature is a real-world style problem, and writing the logic as a function makes it reusable and easy to test.

I also practiced logging test values to verify the results, which is an important debugging habit.

More math-focused practice labs will be added here as I continue learning 🙂

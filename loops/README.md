# Loops Labs

## 📝 Description

This folder contains JavaScript exercises focused on using loops to process data step-by-step. These labs emphasize repetition, iteration, and tracking values as a program runs through a sequence of items.

The goal of these exercises is to practice writing logic that works across multiple values — rather than solving a problem for only a single case.

## 📏 Longest Word Length Lab

This lab finds the length of the longest word in a sentence. The program splits the sentence into words, loops through each word, and tracks the largest word length found.

### Example Behavior

```
findLongestWordLength("The quick brown fox")
→ 5

findLongestWordLength("JavaScript is powerful")
→ 10
```

### Concepts Practiced

- Iterating through a list of values using a loop
- Tracking a running result (maximum value)
- Working with word lengths using `.length`
- Breaking a string into words using `trim()` and `split(" ")`

## 💡 Reflection

These labs helped reinforce how loops allow a program to repeat the same set of steps across many values. Instead of manually checking each item, a loop makes it possible to process a full list and build a result over time.

As more loop-based labs are added, this folder will continue to grow as practice for iteration, tracking values, and writing repeatable program logic.

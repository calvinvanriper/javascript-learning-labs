# Loops Labs

## 📝 Description

This folder contains JavaScript exercises focused on using loops to repeat logic across multiple values. These labs emphasize iteration, tracking values over time, and building results step-by-step as a program processes data.

The goal of these exercises is to practice thinking about how repeated operations work, rather than solving a problem for a single value only.

## 📏 Longest Word Length Lab

**File:** `find-longest-word-length.js`

This lab finds the length of the longest word in a sentence. The program splits the sentence into individual words, loops through each word, and tracks the largest word length encountered.

### Concepts Practiced

- Iterating through a list of values using a loop
- Tracking a running maximum
- Working with string lengths
- Breaking a string into words using `trim()` and `split(" ")`

### Example Behavior

```
findLongestWordLength("The quick brown fox")
→ 5
```

## 🔢 Factorial Calculator Lab

**File:** `factorial-calculator.js`

This lab calculates the factorial of a given number by repeatedly multiplying values from 1 up to the provided number. The program uses loops to build the sequence of numbers and then compute the final result.

### Concepts Practiced

- Using a `while` loop to build a sequence of values
- Using a `for...of` loop to process each value
- Tracking a running product across iterations
- Understanding how loop-controlled repetition builds a result over time

### Example Behavior

```
factorialCalculator(5)
→ 120
```

## 💡 Reflection

These labs helped reinforce how loops allow programs to perform the same operation repeatedly while tracking results as values change. Instead of writing repetitive code, loops make it possible to process collections of data or numeric ranges efficiently and clearly.

As more loop-based labs are added, this folder will continue to grow as practice for iteration, repetition, and building results step-by-step using JavaScript.

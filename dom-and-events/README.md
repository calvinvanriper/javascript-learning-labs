# 🖱️ DOM Manipulation & Events

## 📝 Description

This folder contains interactive front-end projects that use JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and respond to user events. These projects focus on connecting user actions to visible interface changes, reinforcing how structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) work together in web applications.

The exercises here mark the transition from logic-focused JavaScript into real user interface interactivity.

## Projects

### ❤️ Favorite Icon Toggler

A small app where users can mark items as favorites by toggling a heart icon.

### 🎮 RPSLS Game

A stateful browser game where the player competes against the computer using rule-mapped logic and dynamic UI state transitions.

## 💡 Topic Reflection

These projects introduced event-driven programming and DOM state management. Instead of running code once, these applications respond dynamically to user input and update the interface in real time.

Across the projects, complexity increases from simple class toggling to:

- Real-time input tracking
- Overlay UI control
- Data filtering and dynamic rendering
- Stateful game logic
- Rule modeling with data structures

This section marks the shift from procedural JavaScript toward interactive, stateful application behavior, where UI and logic are continuously synchronized.

# 🖱️ DOM Manipulation & Events

## 📝 Description

This folder contains interactive front-end projects that use JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and respond to user events. These projects focus on connecting user actions to visible interface changes, reinforcing how structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) work together in web applications.

The exercises here mark the transition from logic-focused JavaScript into real user interface interactivity.

## 💡 Topic Reflection

These projects introduced event-driven programming and DOM state management. Instead of running code once, these applications respond dynamically to user input. Key skills practiced include attaching event listeners, selecting and updating DOM elements, toggling classes, and maintaining UI state. This section bridges foundational JavaScript logic with real interactive application behavior.

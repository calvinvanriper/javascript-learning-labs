# 🖱️ DOM Manipulation & Events

## 📝 Description

This folder contains interactive front-end projects that use JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and respond to user events. These projects focus on connecting user actions to visible interface changes, reinforcing how structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) work together in web applications.

The exercises here mark the transition from logic-focused JavaScript into real user interface interactivity, where application state and user input directly control what is rendered on screen.

## Projects

### ❤️ Favorite Icon Toggler

A small app where users can mark items as favorites by toggling a heart icon.

## 💡 Topic Reflection

These projects introduced event-driven programming and DOM state management. Instead of executing once and finishing, these applications respond continuously to user input and update the interface in real time.

As complexity increased, the focus expanded from simple class toggling to structured UI patterns driven by data and application state, including:

- Real-time input tracking and validation
- Overlay and visibility state control
- Data filtering and dynamic content rendering
- Conditional styling based on state
- Managing editable DOM state and accessible feedback using ARIA live regions
- Accessible interface patterns using ARIA roles and semantic state synchronization
- Stateful game logic and rule modeling

These exercises reinforced the core front-end principle of synchronizing data, logic, and presentation. Rather than hardcoding interface changes, the UI becomes a direct reflection of application state, improving scalability, maintainability, and clarity of behavior.

This section marks the transition from procedural JavaScript into interactive, state-driven application design.

# 📖 Storytelling App

## 📝 Description

This interactive storytelling app allows users to choose between different story genres. When a genre button is selected, the displayed story and surrounding styling update dynamically. The project demonstrates how JavaScript can control content rendering and visual presentation through DOM manipulation.

## 🧠 What This Project Does

- Displays multiple story genre buttons
- Detects user clicks on a genre
- Retrieves story data from a structured JavaScript object
- Updates the displayed story text
- Changes the border color of the story container based on genre
- Demonstrates content and style updates driven by user interaction

## 🛠️ Concepts Practiced

- Selecting DOM elements by ID and class
- Handling click events
- Passing arguments to functions through event listeners
- Using objects to store structured content
- Updating DOM text content dynamically
- Changing CSS styles via JavaScript
- Separating data (stories) from UI logic

## 📌 Example Behavior

```
User selects "Scary Story" →
Story text changes to a horror-themed story
Story container border changes to red

User selects "Funny Story" →
Story text updates to a humorous story
Border color changes to yellow
```

# 💡 Reflection

This project highlights how data structures and DOM manipulation work together to create dynamic interfaces. Instead of hardcoding content into HTML, story information is stored in JavaScript objects and rendered based on user input. This approach improves scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns in front-end development.
